Where the mind is without fear
and the head is held high
Where knowledge is free
where the world hass not been brokem
up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;
where words come out from the
depths of truth;
where tireless striving
stretches its arms towards perfection;
where the clear stream of reason
has not lost its way into the 
dreary desert sand of dead habit;
where the mind is led forward 
by thee into widening
through and action
into that heaven of freedom,
my father, let my country awake.
